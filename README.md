Clone the git repository, make sure you have all the needed packages installed (TEX-LIVE and Pygmentize) and then run 'pdflatex --shell-escape main'

If it _still_ doesn't want to play nice, try to remove the '_minted-main' folder and retry.

If that doesn't work, you are on your own.

A compiled version of the pdf should be present in the repo if all you want to do is read it.
